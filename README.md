##  Evaluate Performance of Multi-terminal High Voltage Direct Current (MTHVDC) Systems with GFM Control for Offshore Wind Integration

    <td class="image-column" width=50></td>
    <td class="text-column" width=400> This study evaluates the capabilities of voltage source converter (VSC) based MTHVDC systems in maintaining a stable system during high off-shore wind penetration. MTHVDC system have more than two converter stations interconnected by DC lines, enabling power transfer between multiple offshore locations. You can investigate the performance of various types of controlllers for the HVDC stations including grid forming controls. Use the tools provided in this project to design a MTHVDC system, connect them to offshore renewable sources and evaluate their performance under various dynamic scenario, like, faults, large variation in renewable power, grid outage, etc.</td>
